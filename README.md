## Installation Instructions

Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RLBiomolecularAgent.git
cd  RLBiomolecularAgent
```

Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If requirements.txt is not provided, install the necessary packages manually:

```bash
pip install torch rdkit-pypi scikit-optimize transformers
```

Verify GPU Availability (Optional)

If you have a CUDA-compatible GPU and want to utilize it:

```python
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
print(torch.cuda.device_count())
for i in range(torch.cuda.device_count()):
    print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(i))
```

## Usage Instructions

### Configure the Environment

Ensure that your system has the necessary computational resources. GPU acceleration is recommended for faster training.

### Run the Training Script

The main training script is training.py. You can execute it with default parameters or customize it using command-line arguments.

```bash
python training.py --total_episodes 100 --num_agents 7
```

### Available Arguments

--checkpoint: Path to a checkpoint file to resume training.
--load_optimizer: Load optimizer state from checkpoint.
--continue_from_checkpoint: Continue training from checkpoint episode.
--total_episodes: Total number of training episodes (default: 40).
--episodes_per_curriculum: Number of episodes per curriculum level (default: 10).
--curriculum_levels: Comma-separated list of curriculum levels to use (default: '1,2,2.5,3').
--seed: Random seed for reproducibility (default: 543).
--user_objectives: JSON string of user objectives.
--num_agents: Number of agents in the multi-agent system (default: 7).
--alpha: Learning rate for the coordinator (default: 0.1).
Example:

```bash
python training.py --total_episodes 200 --num_agents 5 --seed 123
```

### Monitoring Training Progress

Training logs are saved in the logs/training*reports/molecular_rl_agent_model*<timestamp>/ directory. This includes:

Training Logs: Detailed logs of training progress and agent performance.
CSV Logs: Structured data of rewards, molecule sequences, objectives, pathway scores, diversity scores, multitarget scores, and rationales.
Model Checkpoints: Saved models at specified intervals for future inference or continued training.
Reports: Comprehensive training reports summarizing the performance metrics.

### Generating Reports

After training, a detailed report is generated summarizing the agent's performance across various metrics.

### Interpreting Results

The generated SMILES sequences can be analyzed using cheminformatics tools or visualized to assess their drug-like properties and potential efficacy in modulating aging pathways.
