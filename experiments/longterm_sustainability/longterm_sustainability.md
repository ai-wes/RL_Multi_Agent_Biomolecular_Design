Experiment 9: Long-Term Sustainability and Continuous Improvement Assessment

Objective: Evaluate the RL systemâ€™s ability to adapt and improve over time with continuous learning from new data and feedback.

Implementation Steps:

    Implement Continuous Learning:
        Allow the agent to update its model with new experiences continually.

    Monitor Performance Over Time:
        Track how performance metrics evolve with continuous training.

    Adjust Learning Parameters:
        Modify learning rates or exploration strategies based on performance trends.

Code Integration:

Enhance your training loop to support continuous learning and monitor improvements.

python

# Within the training loop, after updating agents

# Continuous Learning: Train STaR model on collected rationales

if len(star_model.training_buffer) >= batch_size:
star_model.train_on_buffer(learning_rate=1e-5, epochs=1, batch_size=2)

# Optionally, implement periodic evaluations to assess continuous improvement

if episode % 50 == 0:
for agent in multi_agent_system.agents:
validation_results = validate(agent, agent.env)
print(f"Continuous Validation results for Agent {agent.objectives} at episode {episode}:")
print(validation_results)

Explanation:

    STaR Model Training: Continuously trains on collected rationales to improve reasoning.
    Periodic Evaluations: Ensures the agent's performance is consistently improving.
