Experiment 6: Polypharmacology Synergy Analysis

Objective: Evaluate the combined therapeutic effects of RL-generated multi-targeted molecules compared to single-targeted molecules.

Implementation Steps:

    Select Top Molecules:
        Identify top-performing molecules based on rewards or pathway scores.

    Calculate Synergy Metrics:
        Assess how targeting multiple pathways affects overall efficacy.

    Compare Against Baselines:
        Use single-targeted molecules as a comparison.

Code Integration:

Implement a function to calculate synergy metrics and integrate it into your validation or post-training analysis.

    avg_synergy = total_synergy / total_molecules if total_molecules > 0 else 0.0

Explanation:

    Synergy Score: Represents the combined effect of targeting multiple pathways.
    Comparison: Higher synergy scores indicate better multi-targeting efficacy compared to single-targeted molecules.
