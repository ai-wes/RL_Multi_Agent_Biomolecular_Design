Experiment 8: Comparative Cost and Time Efficiency Analysis

Objective: Quantify the economic advantages of using the RL system over conventional methods in the drug discovery pipeline.

Implementation Steps:

    Define Cost Metrics:
        Assign costs to computational resources (e.g., GPU time).

    Measure Time and Cost:
        Record the time taken by both RL and conventional systems to perform the same number of tasks.

    Calculate Savings:
        Compare the total time and cost, highlighting the advantages of the RL system.

Code Integration:

Leverage the benchmarking functions from Experiment 3 and extend them to include cost calculations.

python
