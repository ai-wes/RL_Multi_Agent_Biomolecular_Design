Experiment 4: Drug-Likeness Evaluation

Objective: Assess the drug-likeness of generated molecules using metrics like QED and Lipinski's Rule of Five.

Implementation Steps:

    Calculate Drug-Likeness Metrics:
        Utilize RDKit's QED and Lipinski descriptors.

    Aggregate Metrics:
        After each episode, compute average QED and Lipinski violations.

    Logging:
        Record these metrics for analysis.

Code Integration:

Enhance your logging to include QED and Lipinski metrics.

python

# Inside the training loop, after step execution

for idx, agent in enumerate(multi_agent_system.agents): # Existing logging code...

    # Calculate Lipinski violations
    mol = agent.env.current_mol
    lipinski_violations = agent.env._lipinski_violations(mol)

    # Calculate QED
    qed_score = QED.qed(mol)

    # Update log entry
    log_entry.update({
        'QED_Score': qed_score,
        'Lipinski_Violations': lipinski_violations
    })

    # Modify `fieldnames` to include 'QED_Score' and 'Lipinski_Violations'
    fieldnames = [
        'Episode', 'Agent_ID', 'Curriculum_Level', 'Reward', 'Running_Reward',
        'SMILES_Sequence', 'Objectives', 'Pathway_Score', 'Diversity_Score',
        'Multitarget_Score', 'Rationale', 'Avg_Complexity', 'QED_Score',
        'Lipinski_Violations', 'Individual_Objectives'
    ]

Explanation:

    QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness): Provides a score between 0 and 1, higher indicating better drug-likeness.
    Lipinski's Rule of Five: Counts the number of violations (ideal is â‰¤1).

Analysis:

Post-training, analyze these metrics to ensure generated molecules adhere to drug-like properties.
