Experiment 1: Multi-Objective Optimization Evaluation

Objective: Ensure that the RL system effectively optimizes for multiple objectives (e.g., docking scores, pathway scores) simultaneously.

Implementation Steps:

    Modify the Reward Calculation:
        Ensure that rewards from all objectives are appropriately weighted and combined.
        This is already partially handled in your SpecializedAgent class via the compute_reward and calculate_objective_reward methods.

    Aggregate Objective Scores:
        After each episode, aggregate scores from all objectives to assess overall performance.

    Logging:
        Extend logging to capture individual objective scores.

Code Integration:

Update your logging within the training loop to include individual objective scores. Here's how you can modify the logging section:

```python

# Inside the training loop, after step execution

# After completing all steps in an episode

for idx, agent in enumerate(multi_agent_system.agents): # Existing logging code...

    # Retrieve pathway scores
    pathway_scores = agent.env._get_pathway_scores(agent.env.current_mol)

    # Calculate individual objective scores
    individual_objectives = {obj: score for obj, score in zip(agent.objectives, pathway_scores)}

    # Update log entry with individual objectives
    log_entry.update({
        'Individual_Objectives': json.dumps(individual_objectives)
    })

    # Modify `fieldnames` to include 'Individual_Objectives'
    fieldnames = [
        'Episode', 'Agent_ID', 'Curriculum_Level', 'Reward', 'Running_Reward',
        'SMILES_Sequence', 'Objectives', 'Pathway_Score', 'Diversity_Score',
        'Multitarget_Score', 'Rationale', 'Avg_Complexity', 'Individual_Objectives'
    ]
```

Explanation:

    Individual Objectives: Captures each pathway's score, allowing you to analyze how well the agent is performing across different targets.
    JSON Encoding: Stores the dictionary of objectives in a JSON string for structured logging.
