Experiment 3: Computational Efficiency Benchmarking

Objective: Measure and compare the computational resources (time and memory) utilized by the RL system versus conventional methods.

Implementation Steps:

    Define Benchmark Tasks:
        Choose tasks like molecule generation, docking score prediction, and pathway scoring.

    Measure Execution Time:
        Use Python's time module to record the time taken for each task.

    Measure Memory Usage:
        Utilize memory_profiler or similar tools to monitor memory consumption.

    Compare Against Baselines:
        Run the same tasks using conventional methods and compare the metrics.

Code Integration:

Implement benchmarking functions and integrate them into your training script or run them separately.

python

from memory_profiler import memory_usage

        num_tasks (int): Number of tasks to perform.

    Returns:
        dict: Contains total time and memory used.
    """
    def run_tasks():
        for _ in range(num_tasks):

            while not done:
                action = agent.select_action(state)
                state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)

    # Measure execution time
    start_time = time.time()

    # Measure memory usage
    mem_usage = memory_usage((run_tasks, ), max_iterations=1)

    end_time = time.time()

    }

def benchmark_conventional_system(conventional_system, num_tasks=100):
"""

        num_tasks (int): Number of tasks to perform.

    def run_tasks():

            score = conventional_system.evaluate_molecule(molecule)

    # Measure execution time
    start_time = time.time()

    # Measure memory usage

    return {

    }

Usage Example:

python

# Benchmark RL system

rl_benchmark = benchmark_system(multi_agent_system.agents[0], multi_agent_system.agents[0].env, num_tasks=100)
print(f"RL System - Time: {rl_benchmark['total_time_seconds']} seconds, Memory: {rl_benchmark['max_memory_mb']} MB")

# Benchmark Conventional system (Assuming you have a conventional_system object)

conventional_benchmark = benchmark_conventional_system(conventional_system, num_tasks=100)
print(f"Conventional System - Time: {conventional_benchmark['total_time_seconds']} seconds, Memory: {conventional_benchmark['max_memory_mb']} MB")

# Calculate Savings

time_saving = conventional_benchmark['total_time_seconds'] - rl_benchmark['total_time_seconds']
cost_saving = conventional_benchmark['max_memory_mb'] - rl_benchmark['max_memory_mb']

print(f"Time Saving by RL System: {time*saving:.2f} seconds ({(time_saving / conventional_benchmark['total_time_seconds']) * 100:.2f}%)")
print(f"Memory Saving by RL System: {cost*saving:.2f} MB ({(cost_saving / conventional_benchmark['max_memory_mb']) * 100:.2f}%)")

Explanation:

    memory_usage: Captures the memory consumption during task execution.
    Time and Memory Savings: Quantifies the efficiency gains of the RL system over conventional methods.

Dependencies:

Ensure you have memory_profiler installed:

bash

pip install memory_profiler
