# DESIGN YOUR OWN MOLECULES BY SPECIFYING CUSTOM OBJECTIVES

Below is a list of the different pathways that you can modulate to design your own molecules.
• "Cellular Plasticity Promotion": Enhances the ability of cells to adapt to different states, potentially improving tissue regeneration and overall cellular health.

    • "Proteostasis Enhancement": Improves the balance of protein production, folding, and degradation in cells, which can prevent accumulation of damaged proteins associated with aging.

    • "DNA Repair Enhancement": Boosts the cell's ability to fix DNA damage, reducing mutations and potentially slowing the aging process.

    • "Cellular Reprogramming": Involves reverting mature cells to a stem cell-like state, which could rejuvenate tissues and organs.

    • "Protein Aggregation Inhibition": Prevents the clumping of misfolded proteins, which is associated with various age-related diseases.

    • "Genomic Instability Prevention": Maintains the integrity of the genome, reducing mutations and chromosomal abnormalities that accumulate with age.

    • "Stem Cell Niche Enhancement": Improves the microenvironment where stem cells reside, potentially boosting tissue regeneration and repair.

    • "Metabolic Flexibility Enhancement": Increases the body's ability to switch between different fuel sources, potentially improving energy efficiency and longevity.

    • "Mitochondrial Dynamics Regulation": Optimizes the function and lifecycle of mitochondria, the cell's powerhouses, potentially improving cellular energy production and reducing oxidative stress.

    • "Proteolysis Modulation": Regulates the breakdown of proteins, which is crucial for maintaining cellular health and removing damaged proteins.

    • "Telomere Protection": Preserves the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes, potentially slowing cellular aging and extending cellular lifespan.

    • "NAD+ Metabolism Modulation": Regulates levels of NAD+, a crucial molecule for cellular energy production and various longevity-associated processes.

    • "Stem Cell Exhaustion Prevention": Maintains the pool of stem cells in the body, potentially improving tissue repair and regeneration capacity.

    • "Autophagy-Lysosomal Pathway Enhancement": Boosts cellular "self-eating" mechanisms to remove damaged components, potentially improving cellular health and longevity.

    • "Lipid Metabolism Regulation": Optimizes fat processing and storage in the body, which can impact energy availability and cellular health.

    • "Cellular Energy Metabolism Optimization": Improves the efficiency of energy production and utilization in cells, potentially enhancing overall cellular function and longevity.

    • "Cellular Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) Modulation": Regulates the inflammatory signals released by senescent cells, potentially reducing age-related inflammation and tissue damage.

    • "Epigenetic Clock Modulation": Influences the patterns of gene expression changes associated with aging, potentially slowing or reversing aspects of the aging process.

### EXAMPLES OF HOW TO SPECIFY CUSTOM OBJECTIVES

Focus on DNA repair and telomere protection:

```bash
--user_objectives '{"DNA_Repair_Enhancement": 0.8, "Telomere_Protection": 0.7}'
```

Target cellular senescence and stem cell exhaustion:

```bash
--user_objectives '{"Senolytic_Activity": 0.9, "Stem_Cell_Niche_Enhancement": 0.8, "Cellular_Senescence_Pathway_Modulation": 0.7}'
```

Improve mitochondrial function and proteostasis:

```bash
--user_objectives '{"Mitochondrial_Function_Enhancement": 0.8, "Proteostasis_Enhancement": 0.7, "Oxidative_Stress_Mitigation": 0.6}'
```

Focus on epigenetic modulation and cellular reprogramming:

```bash
--user_objectives '{"Epigenetic_Modulation": 0.9, "Cellular_Reprogramming": 0.8, "Epigenetic_Clock_Modulation": 0.7}'
```

Target multiple hallmarks of aging:

```bash
--user_objectives '{"Autophagy_Induction": 0.7, "NAD+_Metabolism_Modulation": 0.8, "Sirtuin_Activation": 0.7, "Inflammaging_Reduction": 0.6, "mTOR_Inhibition": 0.7}'
```

To use these objectives, you would run your script like this:

```bash
python scripts/MOL_RL_AGENT_v8.py --user_objectives '{"DNA_Repair_Enhancement": 0.8, "Telomere_Protection": 0.7}'
```

Replace the JSON string with any of the examples above or create your own combination of objectives. The numbers represent the importance or weight of each objective, with higher values indicating greater importance.

Remember to adjust other parameters as needed, such as the number of episodes, curriculum levels, or number of agents:

```bash
python scripts/MOL_RL_AGENT_v8.py --user_objectives '{"Senolytic_Activity": 0.9, "Stem_Cell_Niche_Enhancement": 0.8, "Cellular_Senescence_Pathway_Modulation": 0.7}' --total_episodes 500 --num_agents 5
```
